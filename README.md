Hi, in this repository, I have worked on Spam SMS Detection, a Machine Learning project.


SMS Spam Detection: Scammers create fraudulent text messages to deceive you into giving them your personal information, such as your password, account number, or Social Security number. If they have such information, they may be able to gain access to your email, bank, or other accounts. The challenge is to detect such spam messages. Here I have used 

Machine Learning concept used: Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm with tf-idf techniques


The project dataset can be downloaded from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset


The project is entirely compiled and run in Jupyter Notebook.
